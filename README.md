# Modern Login Form (Glassmorphism)

This repository contains my project for the *One Hour Git & GitHub Hackathon: Team Workflow Simulation*.  
I chose to work on a *Modern Login Form* using HTML and CSS, inspired by the Glassmorphism design trend.

## Project Overview
The project is a simple login page created with only HTML and CSS.  
The idea behind Glassmorphism is to use transparency, blur effects and soft colors to make the interface look modern and clean.  

In this login form:
- The input fields and button are placed in the center of the screen.  
- A glass-like effect is added using CSS backdrop-filter.  
- The design is responsive so it adjusts to different screen sizes.  
- The overall look is minimal, lightweight and easy to integrate into any web project.  

## Workflow Steps Followed
During the hackathon, I followed these steps to simulate a real GitHub workflow:

1. Created a new repository on GitHub.  
2. Initialized git in my local project folder using VS Code.  
3. Added the project files (index.html and style.css) and committed them.  
4. Linked the local repository to the GitHub remote origin.  
5. Pushed all changes to the main branch.  
6. Updated the README to include project details and workflow steps.

## Possible Improvements
In the future, I would like to:
- Add JavaScript for form validation.  
- Connect the form with a backend for authentication.  
- Improve accessibility with semantic HTML and ARIA labels.  
- Provide both light and dark themes for better usability.  

## Conclusion
This small project helped me practice both *front-end design* (HTML and CSS) and the *GitHub workflow* (repository creation, commits, pushing, and documentation).  
It was a useful exercise to understand how to manage code with Git while also experimenting with a modern UI style.
